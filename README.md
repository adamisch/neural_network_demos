1. [RNN (LSTM) Demo](https://github.com/adamisch/neural_network_demos/blob/main/lstm_rnn_demo.ipynb) of recurrent neural networks with attention (long short-term memory [LSTM]), or neural networks to predict the next numeric value. Uses tensorflow.
2. [CNN Demo](https://github.com/adamisch/neural_network_demos/blob/main/cnn_image_demo.ipynb) of convolutional neural networks on an image dataset. Attempts some custom CNNs before capitulating to a pre-trained EfficientNet model from Google. Uses tensorflow.
